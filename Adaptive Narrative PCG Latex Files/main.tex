\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a new approach for text based adventure generation AI and describes an implemented prototype for its core mechanisms. This prototype dynamically creates a narrative, without a pre-defined story tree, to provide an open world game experience to the player, where decisions made can affect the story. This prototype game remembers a user's personality from a static intro game and adapts to the user's personality as the player makes decisions. It keeps track of events that have occurred and picks the next major event based on that information. The game molds events on the fly, changing what happens, the characters that appear, and the possible options the player has.

This paper covers the current stages of the prototype for adaptive procedural narrative generation and the preliminary survey results, rating the success of the prototype game.
