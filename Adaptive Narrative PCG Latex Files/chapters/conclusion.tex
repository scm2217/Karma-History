\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}
Karma History can generate different narrative trees based on user decisions but can be prone to the repetition that many PCG games face. It can dynamically construct a narrative out of potential events, actions that can occur in them, and NPC characters that fit the requirements of the potential actions. The flexible tagging system allows developers to guarantee details and a linear progression when needed, but also allows the story to develop dynamically. The system is still in need of refining but overall shows potential.

\section{Future Work}
We hope to increase the amount of story detail now that our model is functional. Our priority is to add more personality to interactions so that the player feels that their decisions matter. We are investigating what would be the easiest approach to make NPC dialogue dependant on a player's personality and choices. The use of a contextual grammar is also being explored for this purpose; global history values could be passed to determine appropriate gender pronouns and verbs for objects. More events are also needed for our prototype; the current number only displays three potential separate event chains even though the actual content in those events could vary a good amount.
